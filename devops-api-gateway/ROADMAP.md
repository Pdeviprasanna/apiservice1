### Product Development Roadmap

- Phase 1: Set up API gateway infrastructure
  - [x] Docker Compose for Kong (DB-less) and upstream hello service
  - [x] Declarative config for service/route
  - [x] OpenAPI spec for /hello

- Phase 2: Develop CI/CD pipelines for API deployment
  - [ ] Lint and validate OpenAPI and Kong config in CI (GitHub Actions)
  - [ ] Build and publish versioned declarative configs as artifacts
  - [ ] Auto-deploy to test environment on push to main

- Phase 3: Implement security and rate-limiting policies
  - [ ] Enable key-auth and rate-limiting plugins in Kong
  - [ ] Add OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect flow via plugin or external IdP
  - [ ] Secrets management for keys/tokens (e.g., Vault, OIDC)

- Phase 4: Add analytics and monitoring capabilities
  - [ ] Enable Prometheus plugin in Kong and scrape metrics
  - [ ] Centralized logging (Elastic Stack or Splunk) + dashboards
  - [ ] SLOs/SLIs for p50/p95 latency, error rate, and throughput

- Phase 5: Test and deploy the API gateway management system
  - [ ] Integration tests for routes/security policies
  - [ ] Load tests for rate-limiting behavior
  - [ ] Production deployment strategy (blue/green or canary)

### Research Scope
- Optimization of API security in high-traffic environments
- Challenges in automating API lifecycle management
- Best practices in API version control and backward compatibility

### Standards to Incorporate
- OpenAPI Specification (OAS): API definitions
- ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management (policies, access controls, audits)
